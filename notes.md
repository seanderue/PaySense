In the BudgetCardItem file, I will have to find a png. overlay gradient to use if I am still doing that with styled.ImageBackground components

- Need to find out what resize-mode in styled components have been updated to

- Right now, everything is hard-coded in terms of the images & the data. I'm going to have to figure out how to use AWS Amplify to bring that data in.

- In an attempt to speed up renders, I did away with inline styling. As a result, I declared a StyledText component in every font. I don't know yet if that would be better for it.

- Consider using flashlists down the line
