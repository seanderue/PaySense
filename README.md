Budgeting is one of the most powerful financial game-changers someone can make. Forecasting your life goals and tracking your progress is no small thing. That said, budgeting apps are too feature-less, too complicated, or too expensive. So my goal with this app was to use the 50/30/20 rule to allow users to personalize a financial GPS in minutes.
